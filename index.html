      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Driven by a passion for both technology and entrepreneurship, I'm currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science through the Honors Program at Florida State University. Since being at FSU, I’ve made the Deans List in 2 out of 2 semesters. My commitment to excellence began during my time at Milton High School, where I not only aimed for academic achievement but also demonstrated versatility through a range of extracurricular activities. As a sophomore in high-school in 2019, I took a leap into the entrepreneurial world and established 'The Flag Project,' an online venture selling patriotic apparel. Since its inception, the business has generated impressive sales numbers of over $60,000.My insatiable curiosity led me to explore the customer service landscape, with roles at both AMC Theaters and Lifetime Fitness. These experience gave me a unique vantage point on customer service and team collaboration. Hungry for more hands-on experience in business strategies, I’ve also spent time at an internship at Impact Mouthguards, focusing on business analysis, marketing, and crafting real-world business solutions. I currently work virtually at Impact Mouthguards from college. I firmly believe that my diverse experiences, both as an entrepreneur and an employee, position me uniquely to bridge the gap between technology and business, ensuring that solutions developed are not just technically sound but also commercially viable.</p>
